#### Dissenting Opinions

1. **International Flavors & Fragrances Inc. (IFF)**:

   - **Concerns Raised**: Analysts expressed caution due to IFF’s high P/E ratio and the uncertainty surrounding its growth potential despite its ESG alignment. The recommendation to "Hold" requires further review before final approval.
   - **Counterarguments**: Some members argue that IFF’s commitment to sustainability may outweigh valuation concerns, considering potential consumer trends towards ethical products.

2. **Overall Portfolio Risk**:
   - **Concerns Raised**: The portfolio's Sharpe ratio suggests poor risk-adjusted returns. The annualized volatility of 15.4% and a max drawdown of 19% indicate a moderate risk level, highlighting the need for close monitoring and possible re-evaluation if market conditions shift unfavorably.
   - **Mitigation Strategy**: It was suggested to consider tactical reallocations if positions do not perform as anticipated, particularly in FIS and NWSA, where market volatility is a concern.

#### Conditions for Implementation

1. **Monitor IFF Compliance**: Ensure ongoing assessment of IFF's compliance status before reallocating investment recommendations.
2. **Re-evaluate in 6 Months**: A comprehensive review of the portfolio's performance and individual stocks should be conducted in 6 months, focusing on the Sharpe ratio and overall risk metrics.
3. **Transparency in ESG Disclosures**: Maintain clarity in communication with clients regarding potential conflicts of interest and ESG impacts associated with the selected investments.
