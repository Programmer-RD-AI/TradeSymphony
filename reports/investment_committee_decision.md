# Investment Committee Decision Document 

## 1. MEETING SUMMARY 
**Participants:** Investment Committee Members from Portfolio Management, Risk, Compliance, Research, and Client Service  
**Date:** [Insert Date]  
**Key Decisions:** Approve the proposed investment actions regarding reallocations into defensive sectors while considering the risk assessments and compliance parameters.  
**Voting Results:**  
- For: 7  
- Against: 2  
- Abstain: 1  

## 2. PROPOSAL ASSESSMENT 
The investment strategy aligns with the proposed allocation into healthcare (3M Company and Abbott Laboratories) and utilities sectors in response to the ongoing market inflation and moderate growth. The decision to underweight tech giants (AAPL and GOOGL) is justified by the risk of volatility tied to high-growth positions. The risk assessment indicates a moderate risk profile for the current portfolio with a Sharpe ratio of 0.62, demonstrating acceptable risk-adjusted returns, although with a max drawdown of approximately -16.49%. 

## 3. APPROVED ACTIONS 
**1. Increase Allocation in Defensive Sectors:**  
   - Invest 10% into 3M Company (MMM) and Abbott Laboratories (ABT).  
   - Target Holding Period: 1 to 3 years.  
   - Position Sizing Guidance: 5% of total capital for each stock.  
   - Expected Holding Period Returns: 4% annually with moderate volatility.  

**2. Decrease Allocation in Technology:**
   - Sell positions in Apple Inc. (AAPL) and Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL); limit to 5% of total capital for each within a 6-month window.
   - Rationale: Market volatility exposure requires strategic rebalancing.  

## 4. CONDITIONAL APPROVALS 
- Condition for MMM and ABT purchase: Ensure transaction costs don't exceed 0.2% of total trade value at execution.  
- Review market conditions against inflation metrics quarterly before finalizing trades.  

## 5. REJECTED PROPOSALS 
- Proposal to increase weight in technology assets (specifically AMZN and TSLA) was rejected due to heightened risk from economic downturns. Considerations included market volatility and potential undervaluation in defensive sectors against historical performance.

## 6. RISK ASSESSMENT CONSENSUS 
Key Risks Identified:  
- **Market Volatility:** Existing high correlation between AAPL and MSFT heightens systemic risk.  
- **Liquidity Risks:** While generally robust, the ability to liquidate positions under stress could pose significant challenges.  
- **Concentration Risk:** Overexposure to high-growth stocks which may underperform given macroeconomic shifts. 

**Mitigating Measures:**  
- Expand diversification across sectors.  
- Employ stop-loss orders for technology investments.  
- Regular review of macroeconomic indicators.

## 7. IMPLEMENTATION TIMELINE 
- **Immediate Actions:** Execute trades for MMM and ABT within the next month post-approval.  
- **Quarterly Reviews:** Performance monitoring against inflation and economic indicators for continuous alignment. 

## 8. DISSENTING OPINIONS 
- Some members expressed concern over the complete exit from tech-heavy investments, suggesting that AAPL and GOOGL may rebound under stronger market conditions. Recommendation for a strategic partial exit instead to maintain some exposure to growth potential was noted. 

## 9. FOLLOW-UP REQUIREMENTS 
- Establish monthly portfolio reviews focusing on the performance metrics related to the approved investments. Assign responsibilities for tracking sector trends and updating the committee on market changes.  

## 10. CONTINGENCY PARAMETERS 
- Pre-approved protocols include immediate review of positions if market volatility exceeds 20% over 5 trading days, leading to potential emergency meetings for position adjustments.
