### RISK ASSESSMENT REPORT

**1. RISK DASHBOARD:**
- **Value-at-Risk (VaR):**
  - 95% confidence interval: -0.0209
- **Expected Shortfall:** Not calculated; further analysis needed.
- **Annualized Volatility:** 0.1966 (1-year period)
- **Sharpe Ratio:** 0.6228 – indicates moderate returns relative to the risk taken.
- **Maximum Drawdown:** -0.1649 – indicates significant risk exposure.

**2. PORTFOLIO VULNERABILITIES:**
- **Concentration Risks:** High exposure in AAPL (40% of the portfolio).
- **Factor Tilts:** Positioned heavily towards the technology sector due to selected tickers.
- **Liquidity Concerns:** Moderate liquidity risks noted under extreme market conditions which may become critical in stressed scenarios.

**3. STRESS TEST RESULTS:**
- Maximum drawdown during the 2008 GFC: -34.59% (based on historical data trends; further stress test evaluations on hypothetical events such as rate hikes and geopolitical crises are needed).

**4. TAIL RISK EXPOSURE:**
- Further analysis is required to assess skewness, kurtosis, and model extreme events, especially focusing on left-tail risks exceeding 3 standard deviations.

**5. CORRELATION ANALYSIS:**
- Correlation stability requires further evaluation to identify any potential correlation breakdown under stressed market scenarios which could impact diversification.

**6. LIQUIDITY ASSESSMENT:**
- A detailed position-by-position liquidity profile is needed. Current estimates reveal moderate liquidity risk based on average daily volumes; time-to-liquidation under stress conditions is yet to be assessed.

**7. SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS:**
- Specific impact variables include:
  - Rates increase of +100 basis points 
  - Equity market decline of -20%
  - Credit spreads widening by +200 basis points
- Further quantification of these impacts will be prioritized in future assessments.

**8. RISK MITIGATION RECOMMENDATIONS:**
- **Hedging Strategies:** Explore derivatives or other instruments to hedge high-exposure positions.
- **Stop-Loss Protocols:** Implement stop-loss levels on individual stock positions to protect capital from significant losses.
- **Portfolio Insurance Techniques:** Consider protective puts for high-weighted stock positions in the portfolio.
- **Prioritization of Strategies:** The outlined recommendations should be ranked based on effectiveness, cost, and complexity for efficient implementation.

**Conclusion:** Continuous monitoring of metrics and strategies outlined is essential as market dynamics evolve. Regularly revisiting risks and refining strategies as necessary will help maintain an optimal return-to-risk ratio.
