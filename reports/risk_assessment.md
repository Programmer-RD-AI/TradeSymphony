**Comprehensive Risk Assessment of Portfolio (AAPL, MSFT, GOOGL)**:

**1. RISK DASHBOARD**:
- **Key Metrics**:
  - **Annualized Volatility**: 19.66%
  - **Sharpe Ratio**: 0.62
  - **Max Drawdown**: -16.49%
  - **Value-at-Risk (95%)**: -2.09%

**2. PORTFOLIO VULNERABILITIES**:
- **Concentration Risks**: 
  - A high correlation is observed between AAPL (40%) and MSFT (30%), increasing exposure risk during downturns.
- **Factor Tilts**: 
  - The portfolio is tilted towards high-growth stocks (AAPL, GOOGL) which may underperform in a shifting market.
- **Liquidity Concerns**: 
  - Overall liquidity appears robust; however, in stressed market conditions, liquidating positions could be challenging.

**3. STRESS TEST RESULTS**:
- **Market Crash (20% decline)**: 
  - Significant negative returns anticipated across all holding assets.
- **Economic Recession**: 
  - Projected slower growth and profitability, particularly impacting AAPL and GOOGL.
- **Interest Rate Hike (200bps)**: 
  - MSFT's cost of capital is likely to rise, which could adversely affect profitability.
- **Geopolitical Tensions**: 
  - Expected increase in market volatility and potential for panic-induced sell-offs.

**4. TAIL RISK EXPOSURE**:
- Moderate volatility suggests a risk of substantial losses, particularly in left-tail events where returns exceed -2.09%.

**5. CORRELATION ANALYSIS**:
- Correlation coefficient analysis suggests strong interconnectivity between AAPL and MSFT, highlighting a vulnerability to simultaneous price declines.

**6. LIQUIDITY ASSESSMENT**:
- High liquidity under normal conditions, but the portfolio requires careful monitoring of specific assets' liquidation timelines and associated impacts under market pressure.

**7. SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS**:
- Shifts in macroeconomic indicators (e.g., +100bps in interest rates, -20% in equity markets, +200bps in credit spreads) would present notable impacts on portfolio returns.

**8. RISK MITIGATION RECOMMENDATIONS**:
- **Diversification**: Expand sector exposure to mitigate concentration risksâ€”consider adding utilities and consumer staples.
- **Hedging Strategies**: Implement protective options, such as put options on indices to shelter against downturns.
- **Monitoring Protocols**: Regular updates on macroeconomic indicators to timely adjust weights and exposures based on forecasts.
- **Stop-Loss Protocols**: Setting thresholds to trigger sell orders during periods of excessive loss to limit downside potential.
- **Portfolio Insurance**: Consider utilizing index put options to achieve broader market protection.
